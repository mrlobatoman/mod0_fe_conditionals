1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
Nooo. I spent hours longer than I predicted. I had to stop at 9pm, and start again early the next day, because I burnt out.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Depending on my time today (Thursday), I will go back to all the lessongs from yesterday and take better notes. This weekend and the following week, I will be reviewing and practicing all the challenges.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I will make sure to keep in contact with some of my peers post mod0. Maybe set up a study group that meets at scheduled times throughout the week.
